### Digital Legacy & Will Vault System

> *Some things should outlive us — safely, privately, and with dignity.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**DELVATZ** is a secure digital vault system designed to store, protect, and manage wills and legacy documents in digital form.

The platform addresses the risks and inefficiencies of physical will storage by working **alongside law firms**, ensuring legal compliance, privacy, and long-term accessibility.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many regions, including Tanzania:

- Wills are stored physically in law firms, warehouses, tapes, CDs, flash drives, or handwritten documents
- Physical storage introduces risks such as fire, loss, damage, and unauthorized access
- Retrieval is slow and often stressful for beneficiaries
- Verification processes are manual and fragmented

Despite these challenges, there is no centralized and secure digital system handling wills responsibly at scale.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

DELVATZ provides a **secure, encrypted digital will vault** where:

- Individuals store wills and legacy materials digitally
- Law firms manage and validate documents through the system
- Beneficiaries are verified using legally recognized documents
- Access is controlled, logged, and auditable

Supported formats include:
- Written documents (PDF, scans, text)
- Audio wills
- Video wills
- Digitized archives from physical media

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Privacy First** – User data belongs to the user
- **Legal Alignment** – The platform complements existing legal processes
- **Security by Design** – Encryption, access control, audit trails
- **Longevity** – Built to serve generations beyond its creators
